	<p><a name="Education"><b>Education</b></a> <br> Hi, my name is Sanan Ahmed, I am a 23 year old entrepeneur who also studied Computer Science at Uoft St.George (although did not finish my Bachelors). I am making this website in order to serve as a portfolio website for my works and also as a portal for me to link myself to the world of web. As you all know Computers are the future, and this is exactly why I chose to study Computer Science(and also because I like to play and design video games). For more info please click on the projects link.<br><br><img class="myMugShot" src="myMugShot.jpg"/></p><br>
	<p><a name="Projects"><b>Projects</b></a>  <br> I have made many projects in the past. I started working on projects with adobe flash at the age of 12. I had aready been a n avid video game player and I had been trying to reverse engineer some of the game mods that I had been playing since I was a child. So when I started flash animations I also knew about the coding behind it and was able to make simple games within a few months of doing actionscripting. Since then, I have learned to do many things that computers are relatively good at . I have made softwares, graphical user interfaces and video games for both desktop, phones and even dabbled into making games for consoles using XNA. I have even made some simulators, (a fire simulator for example) and several websites. </p>
	<p><a name="Courses"><b>Courses</b></a> I am currently taking Single Variable Calculus, Computer Organization, Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Medieval Architecture, Renaissance Architecture, and Web Development.</p>
	<p><a name="Skills"><b>Skills</b></a> I am a good comunicator due to my past experience at different work placements. I am a good teamworker and I am especially adept at technology and things related to it. More specifically I like programming alot and I have a lot of experience with many different types of programming methodologies and languages including but not limited to: <br>C++,<br>Java,<br>C#,<br>HTML,<br>CSS,<br>Python etc</p>
